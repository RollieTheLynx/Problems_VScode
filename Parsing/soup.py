soup = BeautifulSoup(html_doc, "lxml")

#print(soup.prettify())

# Tag:

# Finds the first occurrence of usage for a "b"
# bold tag.
print(soup.p)

# The "find" function also does the same, where it
# only finds the first occurrence in the HTML doc
# of a tag with "b".
#print(soup.find('b'))

# If we want to find all of the elements on the page
# with the "b" tag, we can use the "find_all" function.
#print(soup.find_all('b'))

# Name:

# This gives the name of the tag. In this case, the 
# tag name is "b".
#print(soup.b.name)

# We can alter the name and have that reflected in the
# source. For instance:
#tag = soup.b
#print(tag)
#tag.name = "blockquote"
#print(tag)

# Attributes:

#tag = soup.find_all('b')[2]
#print(tag)

# This specific tag has the attribute "id", which
# can be accessed like so:
#print(tag['id'])

#tag = soup.find_all('b')[3]
#print(tag)

# We can even access multiple attributes that are
# non-standard HTML attributes:
#print(tag['id'])
#print(tag['another-attribute'])

# If we want to see all attributes, we can access them
# as a dictionary object:
#tag = soup.find_all('b')[3]
#print(tag)

#print(tag.attrs)

# These properties are mutable, and we can alter them
# in the following manner.
#print(tag)
#tag['another-attribute'] = 2
#print(tag)

# We can also use Python's del command for lists to
# remove attributes:
#del tag['id']
#del tag['another-attribute']
#print(tag)

# Multi-valued Attributes
tag = soup.find_all('b')[3]
print(tag)
print(tag.string)

# We can use the "replace_with" function to replace
# the content of the string with something different:
tag.string.replace_with("This is another string")
print(tag)
