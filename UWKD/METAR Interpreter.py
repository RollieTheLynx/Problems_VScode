# TODO Visibility can be different in different directions. In that case the lowest measured visibility is always displayed. If visibility is only measured in one direction then NDV (Non Directional Variation) is added to the code.
# Visibility can also be listed per direction. 1500SW 2000NE means the visibility to the southwest is 1500 meters and 2000 meters to the northeast.
# In case of poor visibility, the direction can also be displayed per runway. This is also called the RVR (Runway Visual Range). An RVR is usually not reported until visibility is less than 2000 meters. Examples of an RVR:
# R23/0500 visibility for runway 23 is 500 meters
# R23/P0500 visibility for runway 23 is more (P) than 500 meters
# R23/M0500 visibility for runway 23 is less (M) than 500 meters
# R23/0500V1500 visibility for runway 23 varies between 500 and 1500 meters
# R23/0500U visibility for runway 23 is 500 meters but increases (U)
# R23/0500D visibility for runway 23 is 500 meters but decreases (D)
